**static (variable)** - variable get allocated for the lifetime of the program

# Class

**static** - the member is shared - it means no matter how many objects of the class are created, there is only one copy of the static member.
**constexpr** - the function/variable can be evaluated at compile time. Better performance. Once a program is compiled and finalized by the developer, it is run multiple times by users. The idea is to spend time in compilation and save time at run time.  
**private (default)** - members of class are not accessible outside class or derived class.  
**protected** - members of class that are not accessible outside of class, but is accessible in derived class.  
**public** - accessible to all.
