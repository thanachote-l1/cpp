static (variable) - variable get allocated for the lifetime of the program
static (in class) - the member is shared - it means no matter how many objects of the class are created, there is only one copy of the static member.

constexpr - the function/variable can be evaluated at compile time. Better performance. Once a program is compiled and finalized by the developer, it is run multiple times by users. The idea is to spend time in compilation and save time at run time.
